This guide aims to help Tunisian public officials balance the right to access information with the protection of personal data.  It acknowledges the apparent conflict between these two fundamental principles of a democratic state, particularly when access requests involve official documents containing personal information.  The guide provides tools for making informed, balanced decisions without requiring advanced legal knowledge. While primarily intended for public administration, it also offers useful information for individuals exercising their right to access information.  The guide was produced with the support of the European Union and the Council of Europe, and is available online at www.inai.tn and www.inpdp.tn.  It addresses challenges, relevant legal frameworks (including international and national provisions), and a step-by-step process for evaluating access requests involving personal data, emphasizing the principle of proportionality and the weighing of competing interests.  The guide includes examples from case law of the National Authority for Access to Information (INAI) and the National Authority for the Protection of Personal Data (INPDP).  Contact information for both authorities is provided.
