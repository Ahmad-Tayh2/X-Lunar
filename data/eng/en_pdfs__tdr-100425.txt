**Appel à Propositions: Programme de Valorisation des Résultats de la Recherche et Transfert des Connaissances (VRR) 2025**

**I. Contexte:**  The valorization of research results is an essential step in research, development, and innovation.  This program aims to promote scientific research and value creation through strengthened research teams, resource sharing, and research/industry partnerships.  It targets Tunisian higher education and research institutions (EESR) and research centers (CR) with collaborative projects aligned with national research priorities.  The Directorate General for Research Valorization (DGVR) will evaluate, select, implement, and monitor projects.

**II. Objectives:** To support research and innovation actors in the valorization and transfer of scientific research results, implementing new technological solutions addressing societal and economic needs.  Specific objectives include: strengthening R&D&I collaboration; accelerating innovation transfer to the socio-economic environment; supporting research result maturation for exploitation/knowledge and technology transfer; and supporting entrepreneurship and startup/spin-off creation.

**III. Target Themes:** Projects with high innovation potential and significant socio-economic impact in the following areas: water, energy, and food security; citizen health; digital transition and artificial intelligence; circular economy; and advanced and sustainable materials.

**IV. Eligibility:**

* **4.1 Eligible Projects:** Projects addressing the stated objectives, focusing on technology, product, or service development requiring R&D&I; products/processes demonstrating economic potential and significant deployment potential; and addressing technical/economic uncertainties for/with partner companies.  The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) must be ≥4 ("Technology validated in laboratory"). Projects will be funded for a maximum of 24 months.

* **4.2 Eligible Consortium:** Public higher education and research institutions (EESR) or public scientific research centers (CR), including those under dual supervision with other ministries.  EESR/CR contribution: minimum 5% of MESRS allocation.  The project team should include a maximum of three young graduates (PhD students, post-docs, engineers) to foster their employability.  Public/private partnerships (industrial and/or socio-economic) are required.  European entities can participate as partners (without funding).

* **4.3 Project Coordinator:** A permanent researcher with at least the rank of Maître Assistant or equivalent from a public institution (EESR or CR), active throughout the project duration.  Coordinators with ongoing VRR projects can only apply if their previous project is in its final year.

* **4.4 Socio-economic Partners:** Public or private companies, SMEs, established startups, public/parapublic sector organizations, municipalities, local authorities, and NGOs working in research and innovation.  Their total contribution should be at least 10% of the MESRS budget (minimum 5% cash, 5% in-kind).

* **4.5 Eligible Expenses:** Expenses covering predefined activities to achieve expected results (scale-up, testing, real-world demonstration, service/research contracts [post-docs, PhD students, engineers], travel within Tunisia).  Specific budget ceilings are defined per expense category.

* **4.6 Ineligible Expenses:** Expenses not directly related to project activities and objectives (staff salaries, vehicles, land acquisition, building construction/renovation, office space, IT equipment, office supplies).


**V. Submission and Evaluation Process:**

Institutions must submit a completed application form (available on the MESRS website: http://www.mes.tn) with scientific council approval and signatures from the project leader, institution head, and socio-economic partner(s). The submission deadline is Thursday, May 15, 2025.  The submission must include: the completed application form; letters of commitment from socio-economic partners; a letter of approval from the institution's legal representative; CVs of consortium members; a list of completed projects; a confidentiality agreement (if necessary); an intellectual property agreement (if necessary); pro-forma invoices for equipment; and a project implementation plan.  MESRS will ensure eligibility and evaluation by independent experts.

**VI. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Impact Analysis:**

Selected projects will be subject to annual monitoring and evaluation.  Funding phases will depend on evaluation results.  Monitoring will focus on project maturation rate, intellectual property valorization, incubated projects, licenses, theses, and graduate employment rates.

**VII. Intellectual Property:** Intellectual property will be handled according to Tunisian legislation, with MESRS/DGVR assistance.
